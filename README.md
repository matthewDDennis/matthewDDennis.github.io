## Matthew Dennis

### Full-Stack Developer, Application Architect, Quality Assurance, Performance Optimiser, Code Sleuth, Project Manager, always learning.

***

I have been writing software for more the 40 years and have held many roles and titles during that time. I have been developing in C# since the first Visual Studio .NET Beta in 2001/2002, and longer in C++. I strive to keep up to date on the latest features, frameworks, NuGet packages, architecture guidance and best practices.  However, I also read and write many other languages, including Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Pascal, SQL and more.

I enjoy writing software and solving problems. I have a passion for quality and performance. I actually like digging into difficult bugs and performance issues, being the Code Sleuth.

I have a rich history of roles that span from hardware design to software architecture, giving me a unique perspective on the full technology stack. My ability to bridge the gap between technical teams and executive leadership has consistently resulted in the successful delivery of projects that meet both business and technical objectives. Whether leading a team in building AI-powered solutions or ensuring seamless project management, I am committed to delivering high-impact results with precision and creativity.

For the last 15 years, I was the Senior Software Architect and Developer for [CodeProject](https://www.codeproject.com/), a website for developers, where I was responsible for the architecture and development of the website and its supporting services. These roles involved improving system performance, enhancing user experience, and spearheading critical feature developments in .NET and AI technologies. Adept at problem-solving and committed to continuous learning, I brought creative solutions to complex challenges, from software architecture to performance optimization.
