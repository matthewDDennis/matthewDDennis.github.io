Welcome to the Code Sleuth blog! I am a software developer and detective, and I will be sharing my adventures in solving mysteries and puzzles in the world of software development. Each post will focus on a different case, and we will collect the clues and information needed to solve it. I will also provide the solutions to the cases, so you can see how I solved them. I hope you enjoy reading about my adventures as much as I enjoy solving them!

Despite working for 15+ years at the CodeProject providing solutions allowing others to show off their brand and experience, I have not taken the time to show off my own brand and experience. This blog is my attempt to rectify that.

Over the years, I have worked on a wide range of projects, from web applications to mobile apps to desktop software. I have experience with a variety of programming languages, frameworks, and tools, and I enjoy learning new technologies and solving challenging problems. I am always looking for new opportunities to expand my skills and take on new challenges. In the proces, I have delved into architecture, design, development and performance of software systems and processes. I have learned a lot along the way. I hope to share some of that knowledge with you through this blog.

Many of the cases I will be sharing are based on real-world problems I have encountered in my work, or experiments I created to understand a new concept. I will walk you through the process of solving these problems, from identifying the issue to implementing the solution. I will also provide tips and best practices that I have learned along the way. I hope that you will find these posts helpful and informative, and that they will inspire you to tackle your own software development challenges with confidence.

"The game is afoot!" as Sherlock Holmes would say.
